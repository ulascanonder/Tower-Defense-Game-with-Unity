Here is an experimental Tower Defense game I've made using Unity.

Notes:
The game is designed to run with 1125 x 2436 resolution.
Gameplay instructions are present in the game itself.
I've used DOTween (HOTween v2) asset for tweening.
I've also used Pixel Art Top Down - Basic asset for visual decoration.
